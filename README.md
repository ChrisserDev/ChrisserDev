Hi there! 👋

I'm Cristian Serban, a front-end developer with a keen eye for creating engaging and user-friendly web experiences. 💻✨

#### 🚀 About Me

I delved into the world of coding during my Master's Degree in Audio Engineering back in 2019 where I got my first taste of coding in C++ while working on an audio effect project. Despite creating a cool delay effect that I enjoyed building, I’ve realised that coding might not be my true calling. This awareness dawned upon me when my teacher emphasized the importance of having a strong grasp of complex mathematics in the programming field.

Fast forward two years after finishing my master's, I decided to give coding another shot. I took a free course on learning Python on LinkedIn and thought, "Maybe I'll like this." But, once again, I hit a roadblock with complex math operations when I tried learning Audio Digital Signal Processing in Phyton.

Then, in December 2022, I stumbled upon a mobile app called Mimo, and everything changed. I started learning Front-End Development, covering the basics like loops, if statements, and functions. A month later, I joined their 6-month Front-End Development bootcamp. During the bootcamp, I dove into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

It was awesome! I built a bunch of projects, and six months later, I realised that my love for coding and creating applications bring me joy and satisfaction. Since then, I've kept learning and developing my skills as well as developing applications.

So, that's a bit about my coding journey so far. I'm thrilled about the progress I've made, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next chapter.
