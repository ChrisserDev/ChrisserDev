#### Hi there! 👋

I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer, currently working with JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS/SASS, React, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, GraphQL, and GCP. My toolkit also includes Git/GitHub, GithubActions, testing (Playwright & Jest), and modern build tools (Webpack).

Right now, I’m diving into Next.js and learning how to layer TypeScript more effectively across my projects.

If you’d like to see what I’ve been working on, follow my work log on #Github and updates here on LinkedIn. I share progress, small wins, and experiments as I keep building and learning.
